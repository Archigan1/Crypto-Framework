$ git clone https://github.com/Archigan1/Crypto-Framework.git
$ cd Crypto-Framework
```

To install and set up the library, run:

```sh
$ npm i --save-dev crypto-framework

```

## API

Check our (future!) documentation page for API usage.

**NOTE:** The API *does, in fact, exist,* but we don't have any official documentation page yet. I'll sum it up here, with the classes and their methods (hover over the methods in the code for a description):

```ts
// Block class
Block(data: Array<Transaction>, previousHash: string | null);
Block.mine(difficulty: number);
Block.hasValidTransactions(chain: Chain): boolean;

// Chain class
Chain(chain: Array<Block>, difficulty: number);
static Chain.create(firstUserAddress: string): Chain;
Chain.addBlock(transactions: Array<Transaction>);
Chain.isValid(): boolean;
Chain.addTransaction(transaction: Transaction);

// Transaction class
Transaction(senderPubKey: string, receiverPubKey: string, amount: number);
Transaction.sign(wallet: Wallet);
Transaction.isValid(chain: Chain): string | number | boolean;

// Wallet class
Wallet();
Wallet.send(amount: number, receiver: string, blockchain: Chain);
```
