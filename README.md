# Crypto Framework

> Welcome to the repository for the NodeJS package [crypto-framework!](https://npmjs.com/package/crypto-framework)
> This package is meant to be used for a building block to your own cryptocurrency.

## FOREWARNING
> You only need to download the latest version v1.2.0. v1.2.1 and v1.2.2 are simply README updates.

> If v1.2.0 causes issues, you can download the latest 100% stable version, v1.1.1, like so:

```npm i  --save crypto-framework@1.1.1```

> v1.2.0 Added new custom error types, and the places where I added my new `ValidationError` may cause it to break. This works at runtime, but in production may misbehave due to how TypeScript handles errors. v1.3.0 will hopefully fix this issue.

## Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS (version 10 or later) and npm.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.
To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command.

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
6.14.12
v10.24.1
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Installation

**BEFORE YOU INSTALL:** please read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)

Start with cloning this repo on your local machine:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Archigan1/Crypto-Framework.git
$ cd Crypto-Framework
```

To install and set up the library, run:

```sh
$ npm i --save crypto-framework
$ yarn add crypto-framework
$ pnpm add crypto-framework
```

## API

Check our (future!) documentation page for API usage.

**NOTE:** The API *does, in fact, exist,* but we don't have any official documentation page yet. I'll sum it up here, with the classes and their methods (hover over the methods in the code for a description):

```ts
// Block class
Block(data: Array<Transaction>, previousHash: string | null);
Block.mine(difficulty: number);
Block.hasValidTransactions(chain: Chain): boolean;

// Chain class
Chain(chain: Array<Block>, difficulty: number);
static Chain.create(firstUserAddress: string): Chain;
Chain.addBlock(transactions: Array<Transaction>);
Chain.isValid(): boolean;
Chain.addTransaction(transaction: Transaction);

// Transaction class
Transaction(senderPubKey: string, receiverPubKey: string, amount: number);
Transaction.sign(wallet: Wallet);
Transaction.isValid(chain: Chain): string | number | boolean;

// Wallet class
Wallet();
Wallet.send(amount: number, receiver: string, blockchain: Chain);

//Error classes (new as of v1.2.0)
BlockError(message: string);

ValidationError(object: string); // READ JSDOC PROMPTS
```
